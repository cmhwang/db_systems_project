# db_systems_project

## Project Description
This was a three-person group project I worked on in Fall 2024 as part of my CSCI 421 Database systems class. We had to come up with a business/system that would require a database with three different roles, then design and implement that database in Postgres using SQL. This project included coming up with roles, designing the ER diagram, nromalizing all of the relations, creating a script to set up the database, creating an interface for users to interact with the database, and filling in the backend commands for that interface. For our business, we decided to develop a catering company that incorporated three roles: a food supplier, the catering service, and the consumers.
