# db_systems_project

## Project Description
This was a three-person group project I worked on in Fall 2024 as part of my **CSCI 421 Database Systems** class. We had to come up with a business/system that would require a database with three different roles, then design and implement that database in Postgres using **SQL**. This project included:
1. coming up with roles
2. designing the ER diagram
3. normalizing all of the relations
4. creating a script to set up the database

For extra credt, we also:
1. created an interface for users to interact with the database
2. filled in the backend commands for that interface.

For our business, we decided to develop a catering company that incorporated three roles: a food supplier, the catering service, and the consumers.

## File Descriptions
- Carrot_DDL.sql: Contains the code that constructs the database
- Carrot_small.sql: Contains code that populates the database with sample data
- Carrot_bonus.py: Contains the python code that runs the interface that allows users to interact with the database
- Project 2 Schema and Description: Document that contains the: ER diagram, final schema, list of functional dependencies, and interface instructions
